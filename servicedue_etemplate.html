            Dear {{CUSTOMERNAME}},

            <p>It is essential to regularly service your system. Solar PriMeg recommends this be done at a recurring two-year interval from the installed date. It is highly beneficial to have your Solar PriMeg system serviced as indicated above, as this validates your warranty.</p>
            <p>Failure to service the solar system regularly would immediately result in having a 10-year warranty reduced to a 5-year warranty period. At Solar PriMeg we have a team of friendly and competent staff who are fully equipped and trained in this service. Please note it is the responsibility of the customer to ensure the solar system is serviced regularly.</p>
            <p>Our first service is done within a two-year interval after the installation. Thereafter a 10% increase would be applied to the servicing fee every two year thereafter.</p>
